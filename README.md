# Loan-Status-Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
This project aims to predict the loan status of applicants using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical data, the project provides a predictive model that determines whether a loan will be approved or not. This can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval processes and manage risk more effectively.

### Introduction
Loan status prediction is a crucial task for financial institutions. Accurate predictions can lead to better risk management and efficient loan processing. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on historical data.

#### The project explores and compares the performance of four machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models
- Comparison of model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics

### Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression:- A statistical method for binary classification that models the probability of a default class.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM):- A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane which maximizes the margin between the classes.
- Decision Tree:- A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
- Random Forest:- An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control over-fitting.
